# hangmans_game
Just a simple code in Python, playing hangman's game some test code commented, and error control so it doesn't explode if u type a number or symbol instead of a character, stuff like that. U also have comments in code

The operation consists in a group of 10 words, one is chosen "randomly" (we all know computers can't generate anything randomly) and each letter superseded with a low bar. U have to guess the word

U are free to edit, play,execute, redistribute, or anything u like with this code, total liberty

Have fun
